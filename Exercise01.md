# Exercise: Making a List
Lists are great. Here are some constants describing some of the things youâ€™ve learned about strings so far:

```swift
let constants = "Declaring string constants"
let unicode = "Unicode characters (ðŸ˜Ž)"
let combining = "Combining strings using +"
let interpolation = "String interpolation (aka Fill in the Blanks)"
let escaping = "Escape characters for \"special powers\""
let newline = "Making new lines"
```

## Experiment
Make a new string constant that is a list of the things youâ€™ve learned, with each entry on a new line. Make sure you add the result to the playground page so that you can see the list properly.

```swift
let list = "\(constants)\n\(unicode)\n\(combining)\n\(interpolation)\n\(escaping)\n\(newline)"

// "Declaring string constants\nUnicode characters (ðŸ˜Ž)\nCombining strings using +\nString interpolation (aka Fill in the Blanks)\nEscape characters for "special powers"\nMaking new lines"
```
