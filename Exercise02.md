# Exercise: A Restaurant

```swift
let customerOrderOne = "fish"
let customerOrderTwo = "risotto"
let customerOrderThree = "soup"

let serverResponseToTableOne = "Let me make sure I've got this right: \(customerOrderOne), \(customerOrderTwo), and \(customerOrderThree). Is that everything?"

let tableOneResponse = "Yes, thank you!"
```

## Later that Day:
Three other guests enter and place their orders:

```swift
let customerOrderFour = "돌솥비빔밥"
let customerOrderFive = "Pasztecik szczeciński"
let customerOrderSix = "小笼包"
```

The server speaks all of these languages and confidently repeats the orders back to the group.

## Exercise
Make sure the server repeats the order correctly without copying and pasting or retyping any of the orders.

```swift
let serverResponseToTableTwo = "Let me make sure I've got this right: \(customerOrderFour), \(customerOrderFive), and \(customerOrderSix). Is that correct?"

let tableTwoResponse = "Perfect, merci bien."
```
